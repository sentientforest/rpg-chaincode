# Character Creation Analysis Sub-Plan
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Phase:** Foundation Complete â†’ Character Creation Process  
**Source File:** ext/pathfinder-rules/player-core/017-028_character_creation.txt

## Phase Overview
With the foundational key terms established, we now analyze the character creation process. This file should contain the step-by-step procedure for creating new characters, including the order of operations and decision points.

## Analysis Objectives

### 1. Process Flow Documentation
- [ ] Extract the complete character creation sequence
- [ ] Identify decision points and their dependencies
- [ ] Document validation checkpoints
- [ ] Map prerequisite relationships

### 2. Rule Extraction
- [ ] Attribute assignment methods (point buy, arrays, rolling)
- [ ] Starting proficiency rules
- [ ] Language and skill selection rules
- [ ] Equipment allocation rules
- [ ] Feat selection guidelines

### 3. System Integration Design
- [ ] Define character creation workflow for blockchain
- [ ] Design validation checkpoints
- [ ] Plan transaction structure for character creation
- [ ] Identify atomic vs composite operations

## Expected Deliverables

### Analysis Document
**File:** `ctx/20250815_character_creation_analysis.md`
- Complete process breakdown
- Rule dependencies and validation points
- Integration with foundation systems
- Implementation complexity assessment

### Design Document  
**File:** `ctx/20250815_character_creation_design.md`
- User stories for character creation workflow
- API design for creation process
- Validation logic and error handling
- State management considerations

### Data Files
**Directory:** `ext/pathfinder-data/character-creation/`
- `creation-steps.json` - Step-by-step process definition
- `attribute-methods.json` - Methods for assigning attributes
- `starting-proficiencies.json` - Default proficiency assignments
- `validation-rules.json` - Creation validation requirements

## Key Questions to Answer
1. What is the exact order of character creation steps?
2. How do ancestry, background, and class interact during creation?
3. What choices are mandatory vs optional?
4. What validation occurs at each step?
5. How are starting equipment and money determined?
6. What happens if a player wants to modify choices later?

## Dependencies & Integration
- **Requires:** Foundation systems (attributes, proficiencies, currency)
- **Enables:** Ancestry selection, background choice, class selection
- **Informs:** All subsequent character development systems

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete understanding of creation process flow
- [ ] All decision points and validations identified
- [ ] Clear integration path with existing RPG chaincode
- [ ] Machine-readable process definition created
- [ ] Foundation for next phase (ancestries/backgrounds) established
