# RPG Rules Extraction Master Plan
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Project:** RPG Chaincode - RPG Rules Implementation

## Overview
This plan outlines a systematic approach to extracting, analyzing, and implementing ORC-licensed RPG rules from the Player Core text files into our blockchain-based RPG system. 
We will process files sequentially, focusing deeply on one file at a time to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Objectives
1. **Extract Game Rules**: Create precise specifications, requirements, and acceptance criteria for character creation mechanics
2. **Generate Machine-Readable Data**: Convert textual rule descriptions into structured JSON files for system import
3. **Design System Components**: Define the data structures and validation logic needed for blockchain implementation
4. **Maintain Rule Integrity**: Ensure our digital implementation faithfully represents the official ORC-licensed Pathfinder rules

## File Processing Strategy

### Phase-by-Phase Approach
Each file will undergo a three-stage analysis:

1. **Contextual Analysis**: Deep read and summary of content
2. **Design Extraction**: Requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria
3. **Data Structuring**: Machine-readable JSON schemas and data files

### File Processing Order
Files are processed in logical dependency order (not page order) to build foundational concepts first:

## Phase 1: Foundation (Key Terms & Character Creation)
- [ ] **010-011_key_terms.txt** - Core terminology and concepts
- [ ] **017-028_character_creation.txt** - Character creation process and rules

## Phase 2: Character Components
- [ ] **041-089_ancestries_and_backgrounds.txt** - Character origins and history
- [ ] **091_224_classes.txt** - Character classes and advancement
- [ ] **225-247_skills.txt** - Skill system and mechanics

## Phase 3: Character Abilities & Equipment  
- [ ] **249-265_feats.txt** - Character abilities and special features
- [ ] **267-295_equipment.txt** - Weapons, armor, and gear

## Phase 4: Advanced Systems
- [ ] **297-395_spells.txt** - Magic system and spell catalog

## Deliverables Per File

### 1. Contextual Summary Document
**Location:** `ctx/20250815_[file_description]_analysis.md`
- Deep analysis of rule content
- Key concepts and terminology
- Dependencies on other systems
- Implementation complexity assessment

### 2. Design Specification Document  
**Location:** `ctx/20250815_[file_description]_design.md`
- User stories for character creation features
- Acceptance criteria for rule validation
- System requirements and constraints
- API design considerations

### 3. Machine-Readable Data Files
**Location:** `data/[category]/`
- JSON schema definitions
- Structured data files (ancestries.json, skills.json, etc.)
- Validation rules and constraints
- Import/export utilities
- **Note:** Avoid using "Pathfinder" name in data files

## Implementation Phases

### Current Phase: Foundation Analysis
**File:** 010-011_key_terms.txt  
**Focus:** Understanding core RPG terminology and establishing foundational concepts

### Next Steps Checklist
- [ ] Read and analyze key_terms.txt completely
- [ ] Document all important terminology and definitions
- [ ] Identify system-wide concepts that affect other components
- [ ] Create glossary for development team
- [ ] Design basic data types and enums

## Quality Standards

### Rule Accuracy
- Every rule implementation must be verifiable against source text
- Maintain traceability from code back to specific rule sections
- Document any simplifications or adaptations required for blockchain

### Data Integrity  
- All JSON schemas must validate successfully
- Implement comprehensive validation rules
- Ensure data consistency across related systems

### Development Standards
- Follow existing RPG chaincode patterns and conventions
- Maintain blockchain-appropriate data structures
- Design for gas efficiency and storage optimization

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Rule Complexity**: Some Pathfinder rules may be too complex for initial blockchain implementation
2. **Data Volume**: Large datasets (spells, equipment) may impact blockchain performance  
3. **Rule Dependencies**: Complex interconnections between different game systems

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simplified rule subsets and iterate
- Design for off-chain data with on-chain validation
- Create clear separation between rule logic and game state

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All 8 files completely analyzed and documented
- [ ] Machine-readable JSON files for all game components
- [ ] Working character creation flow with rule validation
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all implemented rules
- [ ] Documentation enabling future rule additions

## File-Specific Sub-Plans
Each file will have its own detailed sub-plan created after the previous file is completed. This ensures lessons learned inform subsequent analyses.
